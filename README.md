Personal site

DISCLAIMER:
Initially it was a school project but I decided it has potential to become my personal website. However, due to the deadlines, it's not perfect and I will be improving it in the future.

TO DO:
1. Fix mobile view
   - items should be correctly aligned (center?)
   - gifs on the main page should come before/after (to be decided) the block of text, no mixed placement
2. Make the frog subpage responsive
3. Add correct links to social media
4. Review the metatags
5. Use React.js?
